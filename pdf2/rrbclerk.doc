100 Questions
Que. 1 Read the following passage carefully and answer the questions given below it. Certain words
have been highlighted for your attention.
Most people spend (on average) half of their day tapping away at their hand-held devices. Either , surfing the
net or checking notifications. Facebook ranks the highest in all social networking platforms, followed by
Twitter, Instagram and so forth.
Social media is addictive- which is why so many people are 'hooked'. Often referred to as Social networking
addiction,  this phrase is often used to describe someone who spends too much time on Facebook, T witter,
Instagram and other channels. A blog post, Instagram post, tweet, or youtube video can be produced easily by
anyone and shared, which can then be viewed by millions for free. Psychologists and scientists have now
taken the time to study social media in terms of why they believe it interferes with aspects of our daily
life.There is no official medical term that identifies addiction and social networking. It cannot be deemed as a
disease or disorder as the cases are not severe and the habit can easily be maintained or prevented.
Furthermore, instead of spending long periods of time on social media, we dip into and out of these sites all
day long. We check for updates from friends and family as well as news and information. However, the
behavior associated with the excessive use of these channels has become the subject of much public and
sociological debate.We actively post, like, comment and share personal posts. Not only that, we tend to share
and reshare expressions (of either negative or positive) contagiously. But, why?
Scientists believed some years ago that, dopamine was simply a pleasure chemical in the brain. Recent
studies have shown that; dopamine actually produces the desire in people to 'want' by drawing out the need
for us to -seek and search. Creating the ultimate drive to find what is that what we want.
Dopamine is spontaneous. It’s stimulated by unpredictability and small bits of information as well as reward
cues which are the same conditions that social media presents to all users. In addition, the pull of dopamine is
so strong that recent studies have shown that tweeting, for example, can be harder to resist than cigarettes and
alcohol!
Researchers at Chicago University studied the effects of social media. They concluded quite quickly that
people presented higher levels of addiction to social media than the need to smoke or drink. Media cravings
ranked higher.And, let’s not forget oxytocin, many call it the cuddle chemical because the brain releases pleasure chemicals
that transpire usually when you kiss and hug- or tweet. It is also known as the hormone that builds the strong
yet unique bond between mothers and their babies. Oxytocin is now regarded as the human stimulant of
empathy, generosity, trust, and more. These are factors which many advertisers and marketers play on when
promoting a brand or business over social media.
Nevertheless, problems have arisen most commonly with school kids - whereby mobile phone devices have
been confiscated  because exam results have fallen severely due to lack of attention on homework or studies.
Schools in many westernized countries have had to take drastic action - banning smartphones, iPad and most
portable devices from school premises- as it is claimed to be a huge distraction. Whereas, other schools use it
for educational purposes and as a rewards system for their pupils.Research has also indicated unsurprisingly that Facebook is the most common activity that university
students switch to, when studying. Worryingly, it has also found that those who most engage in this type of
internet browsing tend to have lower levels of educational achievement.
Also, there have been many cases of students posting or sharing content that is unethical, which has caused
parents and academic institutions to limit the use of these online networking channels.
Which is the most common activity that university students switch to when studying?
Youtube 1.
Facebook 2.
Twitter 3.
Whatsapp 4.

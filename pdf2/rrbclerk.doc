"number": 121 Direction : Read the passage given below and answer the following questions.
In today's work environment, one of the key characteristics that companies look for in their
employees is emotional intelligence. Research shows that emotional intelligence counts for twice as much asintelligence and technical skills combined, in determining who will be a key asset to the company . The concept
of "emotional intelligence” in the workplace is the ability to understand and manage one's own emotions and
understand the emotions of others so that they can ______ on shared goals. Employees who are able to handle
their emotions effectively while also understanding the emotional needs of their colleagues can be greatly
valuable to any company. According to a recent study, 41% of employees say they feel burned out  from work,
while 45% say they are emotionally drained. More importantly, around 35% of employees reported experiencing
symptoms of depression often at work. Emotional intelligence is one of the qualities that helps maintain a
company culture together in such an environment. It helps employees listen to one another , recognize and
address problems without being rattled , and approach every situation with genuine concern for the feelings of
others. Managers have a significant influence on the workplace and so, they must be the first to understand how
their own emotions can affect their colleagues. Emotional intelligence in leaders demonstrates the ability to take
responsibility and personal accountability and to step into stressful situations. Companies use a variety of
methods to evaluate the emotional intelligence of their employees. Pre-employment assessments allow hiring
managers to get the picture of  a potential employee’s character and interpersonal skills as well as their cognitive
and communication skills. A more thorough evaluation can be made by asking candidates about their previous
work experience, especially regarding the way they handle various situations at work. Additionally , reference
checks with previous employers or colleagues may be used to gauge the interpersonal interactions of a person.
With the increasing automation of jobs, the only roles that cannot be fulfilled by machines will be those jobs that
require situational awareness and visualizing the future, which requires an understanding of values and

emotions and to empathize with others. In short, technical skills will need to be complemented by strong social
and collaboration skills in the workplace.
